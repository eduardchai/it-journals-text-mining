Building on previous research on information systems outsourcing, a theoretical framework for exploring the opensourcing phenomenon is derived. The first phase of the research concerned qualitative case studies involving three commercial organizations (IONA Technologies, Philips Medical Systems, and Telefonica) that had ""liberated"" what had hitherto been proprietary software and sought to grow a global open source community around their product. We followed this with a large-scale survey involving additional exemplars of the phenomenon. The study identifies a number of symmetrical and complementary customer and community obligations that are associated with opensourcing success. We also identify a number of tension points on which customer and community perceptions tend to vary. Overall the key watchwords for opensourcing are openness, trust, tact, professionalism, transparency, and complementariness: The customer and community need to establish a trusted partnership of shared responsibility in building an overall opensourcing ecosystem. The study reveals an ongoing shift from OSS as a community of individual developers to OSS as a community of commercial organizations, primarily small to medium-sized enterprises. It also reveals that opensourcing provides ample opportunity for companies to headhunt top developers, hence moving from outsourcing to a largely unknown OSS workforce toward recruitment of developers from a global open source community whose talents have become known as a result of the opensourcing experience.",Crowdsourcing; Global software development; Multimethod research; Offshoring; Open source; Opensourcing; Outsourcing,Contracts; Information systems; Professional aspects; Software engineering; Crowdsourcing; Multimethod research; Opensourcing; Outsourcing,,,,,,,,"Agarwal, R., Individual Acceptance of Information Technologies (2000) Framing The Domains of IT Management: Projecting the Future Through the Past, pp. 85-104. , R.

Road warriors are IT professionals who spend most of their workweek away from home at a client site. Building on Moore's (2000) work on turnover intention, this article develops and tests a model that is context-specific to the road warrior situation. The model highlights the effects of work-family conflict and job autonomy, factors especially applicable to the road warrior's circumstances. Data were gathered from a company in the computer and software services industry. This study provides empirical evidence for the effects of work-family conflict, perceived work overload, fairness of rewards, and job autonomy on organizational commitment and work exhaus tion for road warriors. The results suggest that work-family conflict is a key source of stress among IT road warriors because they have to juggle family and job duties as they work at distant client sites during the week. These findings suggest that the context of the IT worker matters to turnover intention, and that models that are adaptive to the work context will more effectively predict and explain turnover intention.",Autonomy; Fairness; IT personnel; Organizational commitment; Road warrior; Turnover; Turnover intention; Work exhaustion; Work overload; Work-family conflict,Data acquisition; Information science; Mathematical models; Road warriors; Turnover intention; Work exhaustion; Work overloads; Information technology,,,,,,,,"Agarwal, R., Ferratt, T.W., (1999) Coping with Labor Scarcity in Information Technology: Strategies and Practices for Effective Recruitment and Retention, , Pinnaflex Education Resources, Inc, Cincinnati, OH; Adams, G.A., King, L.A., King, D.W., Relationships of Job and Family Involvement, Family Social Support, and Work-Family Conflict with Job and Life Satisfaction (1996) Journal of Applied Psychology, 81 (4), pp. 411-420; Ahuja, M., Thatcher, J., Moving Beyond Intentions and Toward Theory of Trying: Linking the Work Environment and Gender to Post-Adoption Information Technology Use (2005) MIS Quarterly, 29 (3), pp. 427-459; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural Equation Modeling in Practice: A Review and Recommended Two-Step Approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103 (3), pp. 411-423; Ang, S., Slaughter, S., The Missing Context of Information Technology Personnel: A Review and Future Directions for Research (2000) Framing the Domains of IT Management, pp. 305-327. , R.

Based on theories of social exchange and social comparison, we hypothesize differences in work attitudes, behaviors, and performance across the two groups, and evaluate our hypotheses with a sequential mixed-methods design. Our first study surveys contract and permanent professionals on software development teams in a large transportation company. Our second study involves in-depth interviews with contract and permanent IS professionals in three organizations. We find support for many of our hypotheses but also some surprising results. Contrary to our predictions, contractors perceive a more favorable work environment than permanent professionals but exhibit lower in-role and extra-role behaviors than their permanent counterparts. Supervisors perceive their contract subordinates as lower-performing and less loyal, obedient, and trust-worthy. In-depth interviews help to explain these findings. Job design emerges as an important factor influencing contractors' work attitudes, behaviors, and performance. Supervisors restrict the scope of contractors' jobs, limiting their job behaviors and performance. To compensate, permanent professionals are assigned considerably enlarged job scopes, leading to their lower perceptions of the work environment. We propose a theoretical model that embraces job design in explaining differences in work outcomes for contract versus permanent professionals on software development teams. The results from our study imply that organizations should carefully design and balance the jobs of their contractors and permanent employees to improve attitudes, behaviors, and workplace performance.",,Contracts; Information science; Job analysis; Personnel; Professional aspects; Research; IS contracting; IS project teams; IS staffing issues; Management of IS; Computer aided software engineering,,,,,,,,"Alexander, S., First-year lessons (1998) Computer-world, (32), p. 83. , September 28; Ang, S., Toward conceptual clarity of outsourcing (1994) Business Process Reengineering: Information Systems Opportunities and Challenges, pp. 113-126. , B.

With organizations challenged in their efforts to hire additional staff, IS professionals are being asked to do even more, often leading to burnout, turnover, and turnaway intentions. Building on Ahuja et al.'s (2007) work on turnover intentions and using the job demands- resources model of burnout as an organizing framework for the antecedents to exhaustion from IS career experience (EISCE), this illustrative research note draws attention to exhaustion in IS professionals that spans an individual's professional career. Findings indicate that IS professionals' perceived workload (demand) was associated with higher levels of EISCE, whereas fairness and perceived control of career (resources) were associated with lower levels of EISCE. The influence of EISCE on affective commitment to the IS profession (ACISP) was found to be negative and, ultimately, ACISP fully mediated the effect of EISCE on the intention to turn away from an IS career. The results suggest the importance of studying IS professionals' perceptions regarding the demands and resources associated with working in the IS field when testing exhaustion across IS career experience.",Affective commitment; Burnout; Exhaustion; Information systems; IS personnel; Occupational turnover; Turnaway intention; Workforce,Employment; Information systems; Affective commitments; Burnout; Exhaustion; IS personnel; Occupational turnover; Turnaway intention; Workforce; Job satisfaction,,,,,,,,"Helm, S., Eggert, A., Garnefeld, I., Modeling the impact of corporate reputation on customer satisfaction and loyalty using partial least squares (2010) Handbook of Partial Least Squares, pp. 515-534. , V.

Walton College of Business, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701, United States","Information systems professionals increasingly face changes in their work environment. Some of these changes are incremental, but many require fundamental shifts in mindset (referred to as a mindshift). Within the domain of software development, previous research has determined that veteran developers experience difficulty making the transition to new forms of development. Although prior research has brought awareness to the problems caused by a mindshift and has provided some insight, it has not answered the question of why software developers have difficulty making the transition. This study begins to answer that question by positing and examining the mindshift learning theory (MLT). The MLT suggests that the degree of perceived novelty of the fundamental concepts that characterize the new mindset will impact learning. Specifically, concepts may be perceived as novel (i.e., not familiar to the learner), changed (i.e., similar to a known concept, but a different meaning in the new context), or carryover (i.e., known concept with a similar meaning in the new context). As an exemplar mindshift learning situation, this study explores the phenomenon in the context of software developers transitioning from traditional to object-oriented (OO) software development. Findings indicate that software developers had higher knowledge scores on the OO concepts they perceived as novel or carryover compared to those they perceived as changed. Thus, developers experienced detrimental interference from their existing traditional software development knowledge structure when trying to learn OO software development. The findings have implications for organizations and individuals as an understanding of mindshifts could mean an easier transition through decreased frustration and a more effective learning process.",IS personnel; Learning theory; Object-oriented; Personnel training; Software development,Information systems; Object oriented programming; Personnel training; Problem solving; Software engineering; Learning process; Learning theory; Software developers; Learning systems,,,,,,,,"Aaker, D., Keller, K.L., Consumer Evaluations of Brand Extensions (1990) Journal of Marketing, 54 (1), pp. 27-41. , January; Aarts, H., Dijksterhuis, A., Habits as Knowledge Structures: Automaticity in Goal-Directed Behavior (2000) Journal ofPersonality and Social Psychology, 78 (1), pp. 53-63. , January; Adelson, B., Problem Solving and the Development of Abstract Categories in Programming Languages (1981) Memory and Cognition, 9 (4), pp. 422-433; Adelson, B., When Novices Surpass Experts: The Difficulty of a Task May Increase with Expertise (1984) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory andCognition, 10 (3), pp. 483-495; Anderson, J.R., Acquisition of Cognitive Skill (1982) Psychological Review, 89, pp. 369-406; Anderson, J.R., (1995) Learning and Memory, , Wiley, New York; Armstrong, D.J., The Quarks of Object-Oriented Development (2006) Communications of the ACM, 49 (2), pp. 123-128; Ausubel, D.P., (1968) Educational Psychology: A Cognitive View, , Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc, New York; Ausubel, D.P., (1963) The Psychology of Meaningful Verbal Learning, , Grune and Stratton, New York; Bartlett, F.C., (1932) Remembering: A Study in Experimental and Social Psychology, , University Press, Cambridge, England; Bartunek, J.M., Moch, M.K., First-Order, Second-Order, and Third-Order Change and Organization Development Interventions: A Cognitive Approach (1987) The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science, 23 (4), pp. 483-501. , December; Bayman, P., Mayer, R.E., Using Conceptual Models to Teach BASIC Computer Programming (1988) Journal of Educational Psychology, 80 (3), pp. 291-298; Bazerman, M.H., Curhan, J.R., Moore, D.A., Valley, K.L., Negotiation (2000) Annual Review of Psychology, pp. 279-315. , 51; Bettis, R.A., Hitt, M.A., The New Competitive Landscape (1995) Strategic Management Journal, 16, pp. 7-19. , Summer; Billett, S., Situating Learning in the Workplace: Having Another Look at Apprenticeships (1994) Industrial and Commercial Training, 26 (11), pp. 9-16; Booch, G., (1994) Object Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications, , Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc, Redwood City, CA; Boush, D., Loken, B., A Process Tracing Study of Brand Extension Evaluation (1991) Journal of Marketing Research, 28 (1), pp. 16-28. , February; Broniarczyk, S., Alba, J., The Importance of the Brand in Brand Extension (1994) Journal of Marketing Research, 31 (2), pp. 214-228. , May; Burrell, G., Morgan, G., (1979) Sociological Paradigms and Organizational Analysis, , Heineman, London; Carroll, J.M., Thomas, J.C., Metaphor and the Cognitive Representation of Computing Systems (1982) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, pp. 107-116. , SMC 12:2; Corritore, C.L., Wiedenbeck, S., What Do Novices Learn During Program Comprehension?

Pair programming, a core practice of this methodology, involves two programmers working collaboratively to develop software. This study examined the efficacy of pair programming by comparing the performance effectiveness and affective responses of collaborating pairs with those of individual programmers treated as nominal pairs. In a controlled laboratory experiment involving student subjects, proxies for entry level programmers working on entry level tasks, two factors were manipulated: programming setting (collaborativepair versus individuals) and programming task complexity (high versus low). Participants who worked in the individual condition were randomly combined into nominal pairs. The performance and affective responses of the collaborating pairs were then compared with those of the best performers and the second best performers of each nominal pair. Results indicated that programming pairs performed at the level above the second best performers and at the level of the best performers in each nominal pair. This relationship was found to be consistent across both levels of task complexity. Consequently, there was no evidence of an ""assembly bonus effect, "" where the performance of a collaborating pair exceeds the performance of its best member working alone. While this finding may appear counterintuitive due to the general perception of two heads being better than one, it is consistent with the findings in small group research. When affective responses were considered, programming pairs reported higher levels of satisfaction than those of the best and second-best performing members in nominal pairs. They also showed higher levels of confidence in their performance compared to those of the second-best members. But the confidence levels of pairs were no different from those of the best performing members in nominal pairs. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are presented.",Agile methodology; Assembly bonus effect; Group problem solving; Nominal group; Pair programming; Software development; Team performance,Problem solving; Agile methodology; Group problem solving; Nominal group; Pair programming; Software development; Team performance; Software design,,,,,,,,"Aiello, J.R., Douthitt, E.A., Social Facilitation from Triple to Electronic Performance Monitoring (2001) Group Dynamics, 5 (3), pp. 163-180; Ambler, S. 2007.

Yet, interpersonal conflict is a neglected topic in information system development (ISO). Based on definitional properties of interpersonal conflict identified in the management and organizational behavior literatures, this paper tests a model of how individuals participating in ISO projects perceive interpersonal conflict and examines the relationships between interpersonal conflict, management of the conflict, and ISD outcomes. Questionnaire data was obtained from 265 IS staff and 272 users working on 162 ISD projects. Results indicated that the construct of interpersonal conflict was reflected by three key dimensions: disagreement, interference, and negative emotion. While conflict management was found to have positive effects on ISD outcomes, it did not substantially mitigate the negative effects of interpersonal conflict on these outcomes. In other words, the impact of interpersonal conflict was perceived to be negative, regardless of how it was managed or resolved.",Conflict resolution; IS project management; IS project teams; User/analyst interaction,Data acquisition; Decision making; Managers; Project management; Societies and institutions; User interfaces; Conflict resolution; IS project management; IS project teams; User/analyst interaction; Information technology,,,,,,,,"Amason, A.C., Distinguishing the effects of functional and dysfunctional conflict on strategic decision making: Resolving a paradox for top management teams (1996) Academy of Management Journal, 39 (1), pp. 123-148; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two step approach (1987) Psychological Bulletin, (103), pp. 411-423; Bagozzi, R.P., Edwards, J.R., A general approach for representing constructs in organizational research (1998) Organizational Research Methods, 103, pp. 411-423; Bagozzi, R.P., Heatherton, T.F., A general approach for representing multifaceted personality constructs: Applications to state self-esteem (1994) Structural Equation Modeling, (1), pp. 35-67; Bagozzi, R.P., Phillips, L.W., Representing and testing organizational theories (1982) Administrative Science Quarterly, (27), pp. 459-489; Barki, H., Hartwick, J., Measuring user participation, user involvement, and user attitude (1994) MIS Quarterly, 18 (1), pp. 59-82; Barki, H., Hartwick, J., User participation, conflict, and conflict resolution: The mediating roles of influence (1994) Information Systems Research, 5 (4), pp. 422-438; Bentler, P.M., Wu, E.J.C., (1995) EQS for Windows User's Guide, , Multivariate Software Inc., Encino, CA; Wall Jr., J.A., Callister, R.R., Conflict and its Management (1995) Journal of Management, 21 (3), pp. 515-558","Barki, H.; École des Hautes Études Commerciales, Montréal, Qué.

Business competence focuses on the areas of knowledge that are not specifically IT-related. At a broad level, it comprises the organization-specific knowledge and the Interpersonal and management knowledge possessed by IT professionals. Each of these categories is in turn inclusive of more specific areas of knowledge. Organizational overview, organizational unit, organizational responsibility, and IT-business Integration form the organization-specific knowledge, while interpersonal communication, leadership, and knowledge networking form the interpersonal and management knowledge. Such competence is hypothesized to be instrumental in increasing the intentions of IT professionals to develop and strengthen the relationship with their clients. The first step in the study was to develop a scale to measure business competence of IT professionals. The scale was validated, and then used to test the model that relates competence to intentions to form IT-business partnerships. The results support the suggested structure for business competence and Indicate that business competence significantly influences the intentions of IT professionals to develop partnerships with their business clients.",Business competence; Business knowledge; IT professionals; Measurement,Commerce; Mathematical models; Professional aspects; Research; Societies and institutions; Business competence; Business knowledge; Clients; Information technology professionals; Information technology,,,,,,,,"Agarwal, R., Karahanna, K., Time flies when you're having fun: Cognitive absorption and beliefs about information technology usage (2000) MIS Quarterly, 24 (4), pp. 665-694; Anderson, J.R., (1983) The Architecture of Cognition, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA; Ashenhurst, R.R., Curriculum recommendations for graduate professional programs in information systems (1972) Communications of the ACM, 15 (5), pp. 363-398; Avital, M., Vandenbosch, B., IT-business ownership: The missing link for IT-driven value (2000) Proceedings of the 2000 Annual Conference of the Administrative Sciences Association of Canada, IS Division, pp. 116-125. , Y Chan and A.-M.

Interview findings suggest that IT champions strongly value (1) assistance in developing information to help sell their IT vision, (2) a flexible implementation process, and (3) legitimation of their ideas for using information technology. Moreover, IT champions do not want bureaucratic process or arm's length dealings with information systems departments.

The objective of this study is to increase our cumulative knowledge about what top-down mechanisms are being used to promote the coordination of IS activities across corporate/division boundaries. Propositions about how mechanism usage differs under centralized versus federal IS organization contexts are developed based on a synthesis of prior organization science and empirical IS literature. Multiple methods are used to collect data from IS and non-IS senior managers from two case sites with theoretically different IS coordination needs. As predicted, multiple types of structural and non-structural mechanisms were implemented for business-IS coordination in the company with a centralized IS context, and for corporate IS-decentralized IS coordination in the company with a federal IS context. An unexpected finding was that mechanisms for both of these kinds of IS coordination were valued at each case site. The prediction that a formal group mechanism would be perceived as more effective for achieving cross-unit coordination than an integrator role mechanism was not supported.

While reliability is a central concern of information systems practitioners at many levels, there has been limited consideration in information systems scholarship of how firms and individuals create, manage, and use technology to attain reliability. We propose that examining how individuals and organizations use information systems to reliably perform work will increase both the richness and relevance of IS research. Drawing from studies of individual and organizational cognition, we examine the concept of mindfulness as a theoretical foundation for explaining efforts to achieve individual and organizational reliability in the face of complex technologies and surprising environments. We then consider a variety of implications of mindfulness theories of reliability in the form of alternative interpretations of existing knowledge and new directions for inquiry in the areas of IS operations, design, and management.",Is design; IS management; IS operations; Mindfulness; Reliability; Resilience,Electronics industry; Knowledge acquisition; Reliability; Research and development management; Systems analysis; Is design; IS management; IS operations; Mindfulness; Resilience; Information technology,,,,,,,,"Abdel-Hamid, T.K., The Impact of Goals on Software Project Management: An Experimental Investigation (1999) MIS Quarterly, 25 (4), pp. 531-555. , December; Abe, J., Sakamura, K., Aiso, H., An Analysis of Software Project Failure (1979) Proceedings of the 4th International Con-ference on Software Engineering, pp. 378-385. , IEEE Press, Piscataway,NJ; Austin, R.D., The Effects of Time Pressure on Quality in Software Development: An Agency Model (2001) Information Systems Research, 12 (2), pp. 195-207. , Jun; Ba, S., Stallaert, J., Whinston, A.B., Research Commentary: Introducing a Third Dimension in Information Systems Design-The Case for Incentive Alignment (2001) Information Systems Research, 12 (3), pp. 226-239. , September; Barnes, J.C., (2001) A Guide to Business Continuity Planning, , John Wiley & Sons Ltd, New York; Beck, K., (2000) Extreme Programming Explained, , Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA; Benbasat, I., Zmud, R.W., Empirical Research in Information Systems: The Practice of Relevance (1999) MIS Quarterly, 23 (1), pp. 3-16. , March; Benbasat, I., Zmud, R.W., The Identity Crisis Within the IS Discipline: Defining and Communicating the Discipline's Core Properties (2003) MIS Quarterly, 27 (2), pp. 183-194. , June; Bhattacherjee, A., Understanding Information Systems Con-tinuance: An Expectation-Confirmation Model (2001) MIS Quarterly, 25 (3), pp. 351-370. , September; Bloomfield, B.P., Coombs, R., Information Technology, Power and Control: The Centralization and Decentralization Debate Revisited (1992) Journal of Management Studies, 29 (4), pp. 459-485; Broadbent, M., Weill, P., The Implications of Information Technology Infrastructure for Business Process Redesign (1999) MIS Quarterly, 23 (2), pp. 159-182. , June; Chanowitz, B., Langer, E.J., Knowing More (or Less) Than You Can Show: Understanding Control Through the Mindless-ness/Mindfulness Distinction (1980) Human Helplessness, , M.

However, strategic investments usually have an element of risk linked to uncertain and deferred investment benefits. To date, such investment decisions relating to knowledge workers have not been extensively researched. In this paper, we explore the following research question: How do we strategically assess knowledge creation over time giving consideration to complex decision criteria in order to improve organizational value? We develop a model based on economic and organization theory for assessing organizational value with regard to knowledge creation investments. Our model prototype provides managers with a learning tool relating to the timing and selection of knowledge creation investments. Our own use of the tool in simulation experiments yielded several insights which suggest that the decisions typically made by managers may dilute knowledge creation investments. Our results demonstrate that the organizational benefit of knowledge creation processes should be well aligned with near-term tasks. Under instances of high knowledge depreciation, however, it is unlikely that individual workers can optimize knowledge creation process decisions without organizational involvement in matching skills to task complexities. The organizational benefits of consistent and frequent knowledge creation process participation increase over time as the match of skills and task complexities improve.",Economic theory; Knowledge creation; Knowledge management; Organizational dynamics; Organizational theory; Simulation; Task characteristics,Industrial economics; Industrial management; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge engineering; Strategic planning; Economic theory; Knowledge creation; Knowledge management; Organizational dynamics; Management information systems,,,,,,,,"Alavi, M., Leidner, D.E., Review: Knowledge Management and Knowledge Management Systems: Conceptual Foundations and Research Issues (2001) MIS Quarterly, 25 (1), pp. 107-136. , March; Argote, L., Beckman, S., Epple, D., The Persistence and Transfer of Learning in Industrial Settings (1990) Management Science, 36, pp. 117-127; Anderson, J.R., (1995) Cognitive Psychology and its Implications, , 4 th ed, W.

However, instituting clan control in such conditions is challenging as people come to a project with diverse skills and backgrounds. There is often insufficient time for clan control to develop naturally. This paper investigates the question, ""How can clan control be enacted in complex IT projects?"" Recognizing social capital as a resource, we conceptualize a clan as a group with strong social capital (i.e., where its members have developed their structural, cognitive, and relational ties to the point that they share common values and beliefs and are committed to a set of peer norms). We theorize that the enactment of clan control is a dual process of (1) building the clan by developing its social capital dimensions (structural, cognitive, and relational ties) or reappropriating social capital from elsewhere and (2) leveraging the clan by reinforcing project-facilitating shared values, beliefs, and norms, and inhibiting those that impede the achievement of project goals. We explore how clan control was enacted in a large IT project at a major logistics organization in which clan control was quickly instituted to avoid an impending project failure. Our research contributes to theory in three ways: (1) we reconcile the two differing views of clan control into a single framework, (2) we explain the role of controllers in enacting clan control, and (3) we clarify how formal control can be employed to develop clan control.",Behavioral control theory; Clan control; Enterprise systems; Formal control; IT projects; Project control; Project management; Social capital,Behavioral control; Enterprise system; Formal controls; IT project; Project control; Social capitals; Information technology; Project management,,,,,,,,"Adler, P.A., Adler, P., Intense loyalty in organizations: A case study of college athletes (1988) Administrative Science Quarterly, 33 (3), pp. 401-417; Adler, P.S., Borys, B., Two types of bureaucracy: Enabling and coercive (1996) Administrative Science Quarterly, 41 (1), pp. 61-89; Adler, P.S., Kwon, S.-W., Social capital: Prospects for a new concept (2002) Academy of Management Review, 27 (1), pp. 17-40; Arnott, R., Stiglitz, J.E., Moral hazard and nonmarket institutions: Dysfunctional crowding out of peer monitoring?

Growth need strength (GNS) of U.S. analysts is significantly higher than that of U.S. programmers. The GNS of Singaporean analysts and programmers was found to be equivalent to their U.S. counterparts. However, there were significant differences between the U.S. and Singaporean computer professionals for the other side of the motivation equation, the job’s motivating potential. The Singaporean motivating potential score (MPS) was significantly lower for both job types, indicating a need for job enrichment and enlargement.","Motivation, system analysts, application programmers, cultural differences",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of the results show that MIS managers perceive their jobs to contain all the necessary ingredients for motivation, in two areas, however, problems exist. MIS mangers at all three levels perceive supervisory feedback as needing improvement. So do their subordinates, as identified in a previous study. Also, the survey revealed both low social need and high growth need of MIS managers, compared to other managers. These characteristics man inhibit effective communication, both within subordinates and with other managers.

This research examines the relationship between CIO influence behaviors and the successfulness of influence outcomes, utilizing a revised model initially developed by Yukl (1994). Focused interviews were first conducted with CIOs and their peers to gain insights into the phenomenon. A survey instrument was then developed and distributed to a sample of CIO and peer executive pairs to gather data with which to test a research model. A total of 69 pairs of surveys were eventually used for data analysis. The research model was found to be generally meaningful in the CIO-top management context. Furthermore, the influence behaviors rational persuasion and personal appeal exhibited significant relationships with peer commitment, whereas exchange and pressure were significantly related to peer resistance. These results provide useful guidance to CIOs who wish to propose strategic information systems to peers.",Chief information officers; Influence influence behaviors; Information systems; PLS,Database systems; Information technology; Research and development management; Strategic planning; Surveying; Chief information officers; Influence behaviors; Information systems; Management information systems,,,,,,,,"Applegate, L.M., Elam, J.J., New information systems leaders: A changing role in a changing world (1992) MIS Quarterly, 16 (4), pp. 469-490. , December; Ang, S., Straub, D.W., Production and transaction economies and IS outsourcing: A study of the U.S. banking industry (1998) MIS Quarterly, 22 (4), pp. 535-552. , December; Armstrong, C.P., Sambamurthy, V., Information technology assimilation in firms: The influence of senior leadership and IT infrastructures (1999) Information Systems Research, 10 (4), pp. 304-327. , December; Bacharach, S.B., Lawler, E.J., (1980) Power and Politics in Organizations: The Social Psychology of Conflict, Coalitions, and Bargaining, , Jossey-Bass Publishers, San Francisco; Barclay, D., Higgins, C., Thompson, R., The partial least squares (PLS) approach to causal modeling: Personal computer adoption and use as an illustration (1995) Technology Studies, 2 (2), pp. 285-324. , Special Issue, Research Methodology; Chan, Y.E., Huff, S.L., Copeland, D.G., Barclay, D.W., Business strategy, information systems strategy, and strategic alignment (1997) Information Systems Research, 8 (2), pp. 125-150; Chin, W.W., Frye, T.A., (1995) PLS-graph.

It is hypothesized that certain aspects of relationships with co-workers, project leaders, and users will also be significant correlates of job satisfaction. Specifically, the relationship between job satisfaction, role conflict, role ambiguity, and quality of leadership provided by supervisors and peers is examined. A questionnaire measuring job characteristics, role conflict and ambiguity, leadership characteristics, and job satisfaction was administered to 118 programmer/analysts at four companies. The results Indicate that both role and leadership variables correlated at least as highly with job satisfaction as job characteristics and that the addition of role and leadership variables to job characteristics significantly increases the explained variance in job satisfaction.",Job characteristics; Job satisfaction; Leadership style; MIS management; Personnel management; Programmers; Role ambiguity; Role conflict; Systems analysts,,,,,,,,,,"Goldstein, D.K.; Center for Information Systems Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management E40-193, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139, United States",,,,,,,,2767783,,MISQD,,English,MIS Quart Manage Inf Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000574285,

Analysts and users in private organizations may have different expectations and proficiencies than those in public organizations, in part due to the types of applications required. Beliefs about how others are supposed to perform and what motivates them contribute to a variety of behavioral responses. Conflict between analysts and users may have serious consequences that can be very costly, such as poorly developed systems, behavioral dysfunctions (e.g., mistrust, avoidance, rejection), and negative user satisfaction. An interesting research question is whether perceptual differences exist among systems analysts and users about how systems analysts perform their jobs, as well as whether the perceptions are the same for public and private organizations. In a survey of perceptual differences about job skills, job roles, and non-salary incentives of systems analysts, results from 872 questionnaires show that analysts and users differ significantly in their perceptions of skills and roles for systems analysts. Public and private systems analysts and users differ significantly on perceptions of all three measures. The results provide evidence that analysts, more so than users, recognize the importance of behavioral skills for effective development. This difference may be a major source of conflict, with users expecting analysts to exhibit technical skills in situations where behavioral skills are required. Public and private sector differences suggest that even though the process of systems development may be very similar, users and analysts in public organizations may, in fact, be different than their counterparts in private organizations. An exploration of these sector differences should be addressed by future research. Information systems managers may use the results to guide educational programs for users, develop better assessment measures for analysts, and establish better mechanisms for providing important non-salary incentives for analysts.",Perceptions; Public and private organizations; Systems analysis; Systems analysts; Users,,,,,,,,,,"Green, G.I.; Department of Computer Information Systems and Production Management, Boise State University, Boise, ID 83725, United States",,,,,,,,2767783,,MISQD,,English,MIS Quart Manage Inf Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3042989576,

The theory is developed in a study of community-based free and open source software (FLOSS) development, through a research arc of discovery (participant observation), replication (two archival case studies), and theorization. The theory explains two key findings: (1) the overwhelming majority of work is accomplished with only a single programmer working on any one task, and (2) tasks that appear too large for any one individual are more likely to be deferred until they are easier rather than being undertaken through structured team work. Moreover, the theory explains how working through open superposition can lead to the discovery of a work breakdown that results in complex, functionally interdependent, work being accomplished without crippling search costs. We identify a set of socio-technical contingencies under which collaboration through open superposition is likely to be effective, including characteristics of artifacts made from information as the objects being worked on. We demonstrate the usefulness of the theory by using it to analyze difficulties in learning from FLOSS in other domains of work and in the IS function of for-profit organizations.",Collaboration; Coordination; Information systems development; Materiality; Open source; Socio-technical system,Open systems; Software engineering; Collaboration; Coordination; Information systems development; Materiality; Open sources; Sociotechnical systems; Open source software,,,,,,,,"Agerfalk, P.J., Fitzgerald, B., Outsourcing to an unknown workforce: Exploring opensourcing as a global sourcing strategy (2008) MIS Quarterly, 32 (2), pp. 385-409; Bailey, D.E., Barley, S.R., Return to work: Towards post-industrial engineering (2005) IIE Transactions, 37 (8), pp. 737-752; Baldwin, C.Y., Clark, K.B., (2000) Design Rules: The Power of Modularity, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard Business School Press; Baldwin, C.Y., Clark, K.B., The architecture of participation: Does code architecture mitigate free riding in the open source development model?

Carey School of Business, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ  85287-4606, United States","Using longitudinal data of IT professionals' activities in the SAP Community Network, and the career histories of these professionals obtained from LinkedIn, we investigate the relationship between an individual's participation in Internet-enabled open knowledge communities and a major event of his/her career development: jobhopping. We measure individual participation in open knowledge communities by two dimensions of related activities: contribution and learning. We provide empirical evidence that contribution to knowledge communities leads to a higher likelihood of job-hopping, yet a greater amount of learning is associated with a higher probability of retention. We argue that the effect of contribution can be attributed to job market signaling and the effect of learning is primarily driven by enhanced job performance and career advancement within the current organization. A series of robustness tests were conducted to address the self-selection bias and to rule out some possible alternative explanations to these mechanisms. Our work contributes to the existing body of literature on networks of practice and provides supporting evidence that participation in these networks indeed leads to career benefits and status advancements. Additionally, our study takes the first step to fill the gap in the current literature on voluntary employee turnover that has so far ignored the impacts of employee participation in external knowledge communities, thus providing both theoretical and practical insights in the area of organizational research.",Career development; Enterprise software; Job-hopping; Knowledge community; Knowledge management; Network of practice; Online forums,Employment; Knowledge management; Social networking (online); Career development; Employee participation; Job-hopping; Knowledge communities; Networks of practices; Online forums; Organizational research; Self-selection bias; Enterprise software,,,,,,,,"Alavi, M., Leidner, D.E., Review: Knowledge management and knowledge management systems: Conceptual foundations and research issues (2001) MIS Quarterly, 25 (1), pp. 107-136; Allison, P.D., (2010) Survival Analysis Using SAS: A Practical Guide, , 2nd ed.

This study examines the impact of gender on job performance evaluations, job performance attributions, and career advancement prospects. The results show that there are no significant gender differences in job performance ratings; however, women are perceived to have less favorable chances for promotion than men. We found that job performance ratings play an important role In influencing an individual's chances for advancement. We also found that the effect of job performance on attributions is stronger among males than females. Additionally, we found that while the effect of job performance ratings on career advancement prospects is stronger among males, the effect of attributions on career advancement prospects is stronger among females.

This study sought to address this gap in the literature and assessed the career orientations of 464 MIS employees, as well as their relationship with selected demographic characteristics, job type, and career outcomes. The most prevalent career orientations of MIS employees were found to be technical and managerial. Autonomy and life-style orientations were also found to be moderately represented in the sample. Women were more lifestyle oriented and less technically oriented than men. In addition, systems programmers, applications programmers, and software engineers tended to be technically oriented, whereas systems analysts, project leaders, and computer managers tended to be managerially oriented. The most significant finding was that employees whose career orientations were compatible with their job setting reported high job satisfaction, high career satisfaction, strong commitment to their organization, and low intentions to leave their organization. Firms need to recognize the diversity of career orientations so that appropriate reward systems and career paths can be developed.

It has both linear and non-linear relationships with several of the study variables.

Thus, the need to understand and eliminate any barriers to advancement for various subgroups is essential if employers are to continue attracting the most qualified employees. This study examines relationships among race, organizational experiences, job performance evaluation, and career outcomes of black and white MIS employees in a large, multi-national telecommunications company. Direct and indirect effects of race on job performance evaluations and career outcomes (i.e., advancement prospects, career satisfaction, and organizational commitment) are examined. Compared to white MIS employees, black MIS employees reported less job discretion, less career support, and lower levels of met expectations. In addition, blacks received lower job performance ratings and were less satisfied with their careers than whites. Among other things, it is recommended that organizations be sensitive to and work to prevent the disparate treatment of black and white employees in all areas of the company, especially by supervisors, which negatively affects black employees' opportunities for promotion and advancement and the quality of their experiences on the job. Employers cannot assume automatically that black and white employees, or other subgroups, have the same experiences on the job or that their perceptions of their experiences are the same.

Jenkins et al ,,What The Information Analyst Should Know About Body Language,1977,,1,3,,33,47,,,,,,,"The role of the Information Analyst is growing more important in the development of Management Information Systems. This paper introduces a non-traditional subject—body language—to the techniques employed by the analyst. The role of the Information Analyst and the relevance of body language (kinesics) is discussed. A conceptual model of the human communication subsystem, emphasizing total body language communication is developed. Individual elements in this model, with numerous references to the kinesics research findings, are presented in some detail. The authors conclude that body language is much too powerful a communication construct to be ignored by the Information Analyst.","Information Analysis, communication, body language, interviewing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sequence analysis of career histories shows that careers of the IT workforce are more diverse than the traditional view of a dual IT career path (technical versus managerial). This study reveals a new career typology comprising three broad, distinct paths: IT careers; professional labor market (PLM) careers; and secondary labor market (SLM) careers. Of the 500 individuals in the IT workforce, 173 individuals pursued IT careers while the remaining 327 individuals left IT for other high-status non-IT professional jobs in PLM or lower-status, non-IT jobs in SLM careers. Findings from this study contribute to refining the concept of ""boundaryless"" careers. By tracing the diverse trajectories of career mobility, we enrich our understanding of how individuals construct boundaryless careers that span not only organizational but also occupational boundaries. Career success did not differ in terms of average pay for individuals in IT and PLM careers. By contrast, individuals in SLM careers attained the lowest pay. We conclude this study with implications for future research and for the management of IT professionals' careers.",Careers; IT profession boundaryless; Longitudinal; Management of IT human resources; Mobility; Sequence analysis,Career paths; Careers; Information Technology workforces; IT Career; IT profession; IT professional; IT Workforce; Labor markets; Longitudinal; Mobility pattern; Professional labors; Sequence analysis; Carrier mobility; Employment; Personnel; Information technology,,,,,,,,"Abbott, A., Transitions and careers: Mobility as process and outcome (2003) Proceedings of the Cornell Conference on Frontiers in Social and Economic Mobility, , Cornell University, Ithaca, NY; Abbott, A., Forrest, J., Optimal matching methods for historical sequences (1986) Journal of Interdisciplinary History, 16 (3), pp. 471-494; Abbott, A., Hrycak, A., Measuring resemblance in sequence data: An optimal matching analysis of musicians' careers (1990) American Journal of SoCIOlogy, 96 (1), pp. 144-185; Ahuja, M.K., Women in the information technology profession: A literature review, synthesis and research agenda (2002) European Journal of Information Systems, 11 (1), pp. 20-34; Akaike, H., A new look at the statistical model identification (1974) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 19 (6), pp. 716-723; Aldenderfer, M.S., Blashfield, R.K., (1984) Cluster Analysis, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; Althauser, R.P., Kalleberg, A.L., Firms, occupations, and the structure of labor markets: A conceptual analysis (1981) SoCIOlogical Perspectives on Labor Markets, pp. 119-149. , I.

Our narrative review of 33 studies shows that the 43 antecedents to turnover intentions of IT professionals could be mapped onto March and Simon's (1958) distal-proximal turnover framework. Our meta-analytic structural equation modeling shows that proximal constructs of job satisfaction (reflecting the lack of desire to move) and perceived job alternatives (reflecting ease of movement) partially mediate the relationships between the more distal individual attributes, job-related and perceived organizational factors, and IT turnover intentions. Building on the findings from our review, we propose a new theoretical model of IT turnover that presents propositions for future research to address existing gaps in the IT literature.",IT professionals; MASEM; Meta-analysis; Review; Structural equation modeling; Turnover; Turnover intention,Computer simulation; Information technology; Mathematical models; Personnel; Societies and institutions; IT professionals; Meta-analysis; Organizational factors; Structural equation modeling; Turnover intention; Professional aspects,,,,,,,,"Adams, C., Clark, L.M., Goldman, M., Jester, R., Lee, M., Noseworthy, D., Soejarto, A., Thompson, E., Skills Shortages Are Emerging in the CSI Service Market (2006) Publication G00140837, , Gartner Inc, Stamford, CT; Agarwal, R., and Ferratt, T.

The Management Information System (MIS) literature discusses a communication gap between the organization oriented users and the more technical systems staff. It is often hypothesized that systems personnel and users are different in terms of personality and behavior characteristics and that these differences are one of the primary reasons for the existence of a communication gap. This article summarizes a two-phased study. The first phase investigated personality characteristics of respondents from thirty-two large organizations who worked on design teams. The second phase examines, in detail, a system success and failure in one organization. Analysis was performed to see if there are significant differences on personality dimensions between users and systems personnel and to explore the relationship between these differences and system success. An operationalization of Jung's personality typology (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) was employed. The results show that the users involved in the systems design are very similar to their systems counterparts. Even more surprising is that the characteristics of these users are closer to the popular descriptions of systems staff than the analysts are. They also suggest that these similarities in personality types may have an impact on system success. The general implications of these findings in terms of the management of project teams and the MIS designs they create are discussed.",Action-research; Cognitive style; Communication gap; Information systems; MIS design; Sociotechnical systems; User involvement,,,,,,,,,,"Kaiser, K.M.; MIS, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, United States",,,,,,,,2767783,,MISQD,,English,MIS Quart Manage Inf Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0039220004,

Yet, little is known of how virtual team members come to recognize one another's knowledge, trust one another's expertise, and coordinate their knowledge effectively. In this study, we develop a model of how three behavioral dimensions associated with transactive memory systems (TMS) in virtual teams-expertise location, task-knowledge coordination, and cognition-based trust-and their impacts on team performance change over time. Drawing on the data from a study that involves 38 virtual teams of MBA students performing a complex web-based business simulation game over an 8-week period, we found that in the early stage of the project, the frequency and volume of task-oriented communications among team members played an important role informing expertise location and cognition-based trust. Once TMS were established, however, task-oriented communication became less important. Instead, toward the end of the project, task-knowledge coordination emerges as a key construct that influences team performance, mediating the impact of all other constructs. Our study demonstrates that TMS can be formed even in virtual team environments where interactions take place solely through electronic media, although they take a relatively long time to develop. Furthermore, our findings show that, once developed, TMS become essential to performing tasks effectively in virtual teams.",Repeated measures; Temporality; Transactive memory; Trust; Virtual team,Knowledge management; Societies and institutions; Students; Web services; Electronic media; Knowledge coordination; Transactive memory systems (TMS); Virtual team; Virtual reality,,,,,,,,"Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Some Methods for Respecifying Measurement Models to Obtain Unidimensional Construct Measurement (1982) Journal of Marketing Research, 9 (4), pp. 453-460; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural Equation Modeling in Practice : A Review and Recommended Two-Step Approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103 (3), pp. 441-423; Argyris, C., Schön, D.A., (1978) Organizational Learning: A Theory of Action Perspective, , Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA; Bales, R.F., (1950) Interaction Process Analysis, , Addison-Wesley, Cambridge, MA; Bandura, A., (1986) Social Foundation for Thoughts and Action, , Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The Moderator-Mediator Variable Distinction in Social Psychological Research: Conceptual, Strategic, and Statistical Considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51 (6), pp. 1173-1182; Belsley, D.A., Kuh, E., Welsch, R.E., (1980) Regression Diagnostics: Identifying Influential Data and Sources of Collinearity, , John Wiley, New York; Berman, S.L., Down, J., Hill, C.W.L., Tacit Knowledge as a Source of Competitive Advantage in the National Basketball Association (2002) Academy of Management Journal, 45 (1), pp. 13-31; Boland Jr., R.J., Tenkasi, R.V., Te'eni, D., Designing Information Technology to Support Distributed Cognition (1994) Organization Science, 5 (3), pp. 456-475; Brandon, D.P., Hollingshead, A.B., Transactive Memory Systems in Organizations: Matching Tasks, Expertise, and People (2004) Organization Science, 15 (6), pp. 633-644; Butler, J.K., Cantrell, R.S., Communication Factors and Trust: An Exploratory Study (1994) Psychological Reports, pp. 33-34. , 74:11; Cannon-Bowers, J.A., Eduardo, S., Reflections on Shared Cognition (2001) Journal of OrganizationalBehavior, 22 (2), pp. 195-202; Cannon-Bowers, J.A., Salas, E., Converse, S., Shared Mental Models in Expert Team Decision Making (1993) Individual and Group Decision Making: Current Issues, pp. 221-246. , N.

This study examines EDP professionals' perceptions of what makes software maintainable. Perceptions were assessed through a series of factor analyses on the data collected from a survey of 149 professionals from 20 organizations of varying sizes. The respondents were asked to rate the relative importance of various features which contribute to the ease of maintenance. Results showed that EDP professionals do not share a common perception of software maintainability: software project managers have different perceptions of what contributes to the ease of maintenance than those who are directly involved in maintenance operations. If those who manage and those who actually maintain software do not, in fact, agree on the importance of maintenance factors, then the maintenance problem is much more complex than EDP professionals or software engineers might have originally thought. Perhaps this is the reason why, according to the survey, EDP professionals are less than optimistic in general about the ability of state-of-the-art approaches to solve the problems of software maintenance.",Project management; Software maintainability; Software maintenance,,,,,,,,,,"Kim, C.; Department of Information Systems, College of Business Administration, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI 02881, United States",,,,,,,,2767783,,MISQD,,English,MIS Quart Manage Inf Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0008264573,

Within the existing literature, however, a dichotomy has emerged in our understanding of the role played by codification in coordinating expert groups. One strand of literature emphasizes codification as a process that supports coordination by enabling the storage and ready transfer of knowledge. In contrast, another strand highlights the persistent differences between expert groups that create boundaries to the transfer of knowledge, seeing coordination as dependent on the quality of the reciprocal interactions between groups and individuals. Our research helps to resolve such contested understandings of the coordinative role played by codification. By focusing on the offshore-outsourcing of knowledge-intensive services, we examine the role played by codification when expertise was coordinated between client staff and onsite and offshore vendor personnel in a large-scale outsourcing contract between TATA Consultancy Services (TCS) and ABN AMRO bank. A number of theoretical contributions flow from our analysis of the case study, helping to move our understanding beyond the dichotomized views of codification outlined above. First, our study adds to previous work where codification has been seen as a static concept by demonstrating the multiple, coexisting, and complementary roles that codification may play. We examine the dynamic nature of codification and show changes in the relative importance of these different roles in coordinating distributed expertise over time. Second, we reconceptualize the commonly accepted view of codification as focusing on the replication and diffusion of knowledge by developing the notion of the codification of the ""knower"" as complementary to the codification of knowledge. Unlike previous studies of expertise directories, codification of the knower does not involve representing expertise in terms of occupational skills or competences but enables the reciprocal interrelating of expertise required by more unstructured tasks. © 2014 The Authors.

To provide as broad a perspective as possible, the study was conducted by a joint industry/academic group of investigators. A series of focus group meetings was conducted first with representatives of the profession's different stakeholder groups (i.e., IS managers, user managers, and IS consultants) for issue generation. A survey instrument was then designed for data collection on computing trends and changing knowledge and skills requirements. Overall, our study suggests that industry will demand a cadre of IS professionals with knowledge and skills in technology, business operations, management, and interpersonal skills to effectively lead organizational integration and process reengineering activities. The lower-level IS jobs are rapidly disappearing, and the requirements for IS professionals are becoming more demanding in multiple dimensions, particularly in the areas of business functional knowledge and interpersonal/management skills. Our results also found some clear patterns in IS staffing and activity trends that point to the shift in emphasis from a traditional, central IS organization toward a more decentralized, end-user-focused business orientation. Aligning IS solutions with business goals and needs as well as building the infrastructure for technological integration are becoming the top priorities for IS activities. Our results indicate these changes will likely lead to different career tracks with differing emphasis on the multi-dimensional knowledge/skills for IS professionals. The realignment of IS activities in organizations will require corresponding re-structuring of IS curricula at universities. Our findings suggest that current IS curricula are often ill-matched with business needs. Many subjects emphasized in the typical IS curricula are assigned low priorities by practitioners, while there is pressing need to add both breadth and depth to the education of IS professionals. We argue further that the concept of a generic curriculum to meet the educational needs of all future IS professionals is obsolete, and different IS curricula must be tailored to meet the needs of different IS careers. These career-driven IS programs will require the adoption of multi-disciplinary approaches and educational innovations for adding breadth, depth, and relevance to the curriculum in accordance with the focused mission of each specific program.",Human resource management; IS career path; IS curriculum; IS education and research; IS skill requirements; IS staffing issues; IS training and development; SIM,,,,,,,,,,"Lee, D.M.S.; School of Management, Suffolk University, 8 Ashburton Place, Boston, MA 02108-2770, United States; email: dlee@acad.suffolk.edu",,,,,,,,2767783,,MISQD,,English,MIS Quart Manage Inf Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-53349117087,

The essay describes what we believe to be a view of the IS specialists' change-agent role that is very commonly held by IS specialists. We believe that this role, while well-intentioned and supported by structural conditions in IS work, often has negative consequences for organizations and for the credibility of IS specialists. Further, it does not fit the emerging structural conditions of IS. We describe two alternative models of what it means to be a change agent, their potential consequences, and the structural conditions that support or inhibit behavior in that rote. We conclude that increased behavioral flexibility of IS specialists - the ability to switch roles in different circumstances - would improve organizational effectiveness and IS specialist credibility. Finally, we discuss the implications of our analysis for research, teaching, and practice.",Change agent; Change management; Future IS professionals; IS education; IS function; IS implementation; IS management; IS personnel,Behavioral research; Education; Functions; Information management; Learning systems; Personnel; Professional aspects; Societies and institutions; Change agent; Change management; Future IS professionals; IS education; IS function; IS implementation; IS management; IS personnel; Information technology,,,,,,,,"Schwarz, R.M., (1994) The Skilled Facilitator: Practical.

Thus, firms are forced to make significant ongoing investments in training their employees to remain competitive. Existing research has not examined the role of training in improving firm-level productivity of knowledge firms. This paper provides an innovative econometric framework to estimate returns to such employee training investments made by firms. We use a panel dataset of small- to medium-sized Indian IT services firms and assess how training enhances human capital, a critical input for such firms, thereby improving firm revenues. We use econometric approaches based on optimization of the firm's profit function to eliminate the endogenous choice of inputs common in production function estimations. We find that an increase in training investments is significantly linked to an increase in revenue per employee. Further, marginal returns to training are increasing firm size. Therefore, relatively speaking, large firms benefit more from training. For the median company in our data, we find that a dollar invested in training yields a return of $4.67, and this effect approximately grows 2.5 times for the 75th percentile-sized firm. A variety of robustness checks, including the use of data envelopment analysis, are used to establish the veracity of our results.",Human capital; IT services; Nonlinear growth; Productivity; ROI of training,Data envelopment analysis; Economics; Estimation; Investments; Productivity; Firm-level analysis; Human capitals; IT services; Knowledge economy; Knowledge workers; Nonlinear growth; Production function estimations; Small and medium enterprise; Personnel training,,,,,,,,"Ackerberg, D., Caves, K., Frazer, G., Structural identification of production functions (2006) MPRA Paper, , http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/38349/1/MPRA_paper_38349.pdf, Munich Personal RePEc Archive Paper; Almeida, R., Carneiro, P., The return to firm investment in human capital (2009) Labour Economics, (16), pp. 97-106; Ang, S., Slaughter, S.A., Ng, K.Y., Human capital and institutional determinants of information technology compensation: Modeling multilevel and cross-level interactions (2002) Management Science, 48 (11), pp. 1427-1445; Banker, R.D., Chang, H.H., Majumdar, S.K., A framework for analyzing changes in strategic performance (1996) Strategic Management Journal, 17 (9), pp. 693-712; Banker, R.D., Charnes, A., Cooper, W.W., Some models for estimating technical and scale inefficiencies in data envelopment analysis (1984) Management Science, 30 (9), pp. 1078-1092; Bapna, R.D., Langer, N., Mehra, A., Gopal, R., Gupta, A., Human capital investments and employee performance: An analysis of it services (2013) Management Science, 59 (3), pp. 641-658; Bartel, A.P., Productivity gains from the implementation of employee training programs (1991) NBER Working Paper, , National Bureau of Economic Research; Bartel, A.P., Measuring the Employer's Return on Investments in Training: Evidence from the Literature (2000) Industrial Relations, 39 (3), pp. 502-524; Becker, G., (1975) Human Capital, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Beveren, I.V., Total factor productivity estimation: A practical review (2007) LICOS Discussion Paper Series, , Discussion Paper; Black, S.E., Lynch, L.M., Human capital investments and productivity (1996) The American Economic Review, 86 (2), pp. 263-267; Boyd, B.K., Dess, G.G., Abdul, M.A., Divergence between archival and perceptual measures of the environment: Causes and consequences (1993) The Academy of Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 204-226; Brown, R.S., Caves, D.W., Christensen, L.R., Modeling the structure of cost and production for multiproduct firms (1979) Southern Economic Journal, (46), pp. 256-273; Brynjolfsson, E., Hitt, L., Paradox lost?

Highly skilled programmers are more valuable for the firm but participating in open source projects reduces the time they spend doing the firm's projects. This tradeoff determines the optimal extent of programmer participation in open source for the firm. The extent of open source participation may also be influenced by the minimum compensation that must be paid to hire a programmer in the labor market. This is because providing better skills is a way of compensating the programmers by improving their future market value. Hence the firm may want to increase open source participation to keep direct wage payments in check. We develop an analytical model based on optimal control theory to characterize the employment contract that features the best mix of open source participation and wage payments. We also find that the firm benefits more from the presence of open source in a tight labor market (i.e., when programmers have good options besides the employment offered by the firm). On the other hand, programmers are compensated better in the presence of open source opportunities when they have few outside options.

Data were collected from 270 IT professionals and managers in various industries across the United States. Through structural equation modeling, work exhaustion was shown to partially mediate the effects of workplace factors on turnover intention. In addition, the results of the study revealed that: (1) technology professionals experiencing higher levels of exhaustion reported higher intentions to leave the job and, (2) of the variables expected to influence exhaustion (work overload, role ambiguity and conflict, lack of autonomy and lack of rewards), work overload was the strongest contributor to exhaustion in the technology workers. Moreover, exhausted IT professionals identified insufficient staff and resources as a primary cause of work overload and exhaustion.

The purpose of this exploratory study is to understand knowledge brokering from the perspective of IT professionals as they reflect upon their work practice. As knowledge brokers, IT professionals see themselves as facilitating the flow of knowledge about both IT and business practices across the boundaries that separate work units within organizations. A qualitative analysis of interviews conducted with 23 IT professionals and business users in a large manufacturing and distribution company is summarized in a conceptual framework showing the conditions, practices, and consequences of knowledge brokering by IT professionals. The framework suggests that brokering practices are conditioned by structural conditions, including decentralization and a federated IT management organization, and by technical conditions, specifically shared IT systems that serve as boundary objects. Brokering practices include gaining permission to cross organizational boundaries, surfacing and challenging assumptions made by IT users, translation and interpretation, and relinquishing ownership of knowledge. Consequences of brokering are the transfer of both business and IT knowledge across units in the organization.",Boundary spanning; Internal knowledge transfer; IS skill requirements; IT professionals; Knowledge broker; Organizational communication; Organizational learning,Knowledge engineering; Outsourcing; Professional aspects; Research; Societies and institutions; Boundary spanning; Internal knowledge transfer; Knowledge brokers; Organizational communication; Organizational learning; Information technology,,,,,,,,"Adams, J.S., Interorganizational processes and organization boundary activity (1980) Research in Organization Behavior, 2, pp. 321-355. , B.

Although anecdotal reports and the scant empirical studies to date suggest job attitudes and perceptions are more positive for employees in organizations at higher levels of software process maturity, we found evidence of a more complex picture. While our data supported expectations that role conflict and perceived work overload were lower for IS professionals in organizations at a level of maturity where software process behavioral controls are implemented, other results were not fully in line with prevalent beliefs. Most notably, IS workers reported significantly lower professional efficacy and lower job satisfaction in organizations at CMM Level 3, where behavioral controls are the dominant form of formal control, than in organizations at Level 1, which is relatively free of formal controls. Some anticipated positive attitudes and perceptions surfaced in organizations at the highest rungs of software process maturity (CMM Levels 4/5), where the established behavioral controls are supplemented by substantial outcome controls, as IS professionals reported lower role ambiguity and higher job satisfaction than did their counterparts in organizations at CMM Level 3.",CMM; Control theory; Cynicism; IS professionals; Job satisfaction; Professional efficacy; Role ambiguity; Role conflict; Software process improvement; Work overload,CMM; Cynicism; IS professionals; Professional efficacy; Role ambiguities; Role conflict; Software Process Improvement; Work overload; Control theory; Job satisfaction; Software engineering; Societies and institutions,,,,,,,,"Adler, P.S., McGarry, F.E., Irion-Talbot, W.B., Binney, D.J., Enabling process discipline: Lessons from the journey to cmm level 5 (2005) MIS Quarterly Executive, 4 (1), pp. 216-227; Aaen, I., Borjesson, A., Mathiassen, L., SPI agility: How to navigate improvement projects (2007) Software Process Improvement and Practice, 12 (3), pp. 267-281. , DOI 10.1002/spip.309; Agrawal, M., Chari, K., Software effort, quality, and cycle time: A study of CMM level 5 projects (2007) IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 33 (3), pp. 145-156. , DOI 10.1109/TSE.2007.29; Allport, G.W., Postman, L.J., (1947) The Psychology of Rumor, , New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston; Armenakis, A.A., Bedeian, A.G., Organizational change: A review of theory and research in the 1990s (1999) Journal of Management, 25, pp. 293-315; Armenakis, A.A., Bernerth, J.B., Pitts, J.P., Walker, H.J., Organizational change receipients' beliefs scale: Development of an assessment instrument (2007) The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science, 43 (4), pp. 481-505; Baddoo, N., Hall, T., Practitioner roles in software process improvement: An analysis using grid technique (2002) Software Process Improvement and Practice, 7, pp. 17-31; Barker, J.R., Tightening the iron cage: Concertive control in self-managing teams (1993) Administrative Science Quarterly, 38 (3), pp. 408-437; Bartol, K., Martin, D., Managing information systems personnel (1982) MIS Quarterly (6:Special Issue, pp. 49-70; Borjesson, A., Mathiassen, L., Improving software organizations: Agility challenges and implications (2005) Information Technology and People, 18 (4), pp. 359-382. , DOI 10.1108/09593840510633329; Brodman, J.G., Johnson, D.L., Return on investment (roi) from software process improvement measured by us industry (1995) Software Process: Improvement and Practice, 1 (1), pp. 33-47; Challagalla, G.N., Shervani, T.A., Dimensions and types of supervisory control: Effects on salesperson perfor-mance and satisfaction (1996) Journal of Marketing, 60 (1), pp. 89-105. , 1996; Chan, F.K.Y., Thong, J.Y.L., Acceptance of agile methodologies: A critical review and conceptual framework (2009) Decision Support Systems, 46, pp. 803-814; Choudhury, V., Sabherwal, R., Portfolios of control in outsourced software development projects (2003) Information Systems Research, 14 (3), pp. 291-314; Connell, J., Waring, P., The bohica syndrome: A syndrome of cynicism towards change initiatives?

These communities are empowered by new information technology-enabled collaborative tools, tools such as blogs, wikis, and social networks. Collaboration on these platforms is characterized by considerable membership turnover, which could have significant effects on collaborative outcomes. We hypothesize that membership retention relates in a curvilinear fashion to effective collaboration: positively up to a threshold and negatively thereafter. The longitudinal history of 2,065 featured articles on Wikipedia offers support for this hypotheses: Contributions from a mixture of new and experienced participants both increases the likelihood that an article will be promoted to featured article status and decreases the risk it will be demoted after having been promoted. These findings imply that, contrary to many of the assumptions in previous research, participant retention does not have a strictly positive effect on emerging collaborative environments. Further analysis of our data provides empirical evidence that knowledge creation and knowledge retention are actually distinct phases of community-based peer production, and that communities may on average experience more turnover than ideal during the knowledge retention phase.",Collaboration; Information generation; Information retention; Longitudinal study; Membership turnover; Online communities,Collaboration; Information generation; Information retention; Longitudinal study; Membership turnover; Online communities; Information technology; Social sciences computing; Online systems,,,,,,,,"Abelson, M.A., Baysinger, B.D., Optimal and dysfunctional turnover: Toward an organizational level model (1984) Academy of Management Review, 9, pp. 331-341; Alavi, M., Leidner, D.E., Review: Knowledge management and knowledge management systems: Conceptual foundations and research issues (2001) MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 25 (1), pp. 107-136; Argote, L., Epple, D., Learning curves in manufacturing (1990) Science, 247, pp. 920-924; Argote, L., Ingram, P., Knowledge transfer: A basis for competitive advantage in firms (2000) Organzational Behavior Human Decision Processes, 82, pp. 150-169. , 2000; Arguello, J., Butler, B., Joyce, E., Kraut, R., Ling, K.S., Wang, X., Talk to me: Foundations for successful individual-group interactions in online communities (2006) Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, 2, pp. 959-968. , CHI 2006: Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, Conference Proceedings SIGCHI; Becker, G.S., Investment in numan capital - A theoretical analysis (1962) Journal of Political Economy, 70 (5), pp. 9-49. , 1962; Burton-Jones, A., Straub Jr., D.W., Reconceptualizing system usage: An approach and empirical test (2006) Information Systems Research, 17 (3), pp. 228-246. , http://www.atypon-link.com/INF/doi/pdf/10.1287/isre.1060.0096, DOI 10.1287/isre.1060.0096; Butler, B.S., Membership size, communication activity, and sustainability: A resource-based model of online social structures (2001) Information Systems Research, 12 (4), pp. 346-362; Butler, B.S., Joyce, E., Pike, J., Don't look now, but we've created a bureaucracy: The nature and roles of policies and rules in Wikipedia (2008) Proceeding of the 26th SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1101-1110. , New York: ACM; Butler, J., Morrice, D.J., Mullarkey, P.W., A multiple attribute utility theory approach to ranking and selection (2001) Management Science, 47 (6), pp. 800-816; Carley, K., Organizational learning and personnel turnover (1992) Organization Science, 3 (1), pp. 20-46; Chin, W.W., Marcolin, B.L., Newsted, P.R., A partial least squares latent variable modeling approach for measuring interaction effects: Results from a Monte Carlo simulation study and an electronic-mail emotion/adoption study (2003) Information Systems Research, 14 (2), pp. 189-217; Cohen, J., (1988) Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences (2nd Ed.), , Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Coleman, M., Liau, T.L., A computer readability formula designed for machine scoring (1975) Journal of Applied Psychology, 60, pp. 283-284; Cox, D.R., Regression models and life tables (1972) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, 34, pp. 187-202; Dalton, D.R., Todor, W., Turnover turned over: An expanded and positive perspective (1979) Academy of Management Review, 4 (2), pp. 225-235; Darmon, R.Y., Identifying sources of turnover costs - A segmental approach (1990) Journal of Marketing, 54 (2), pp. 46-56; Dess, G.G., Shaw, J.D., Voluntary turnover, social capital, and organizational performance (2001) Academy of Management Review, 26 (3), pp. 446-456; Digangi, P., Wasko, M., Hooker, R., Getting customers' ideas to work for you: Learning from dell how to succeed with online user innovation communities (2010) MIS Quarterly Executive, 9 (4), pp. 163-179; Faraj, S., Jarvenpaa, S., Majchrzak, A., Knowledge collaboration in online communities (2011) Organization Science, , (forthcoming), DOI: 10.1287/orsc.1100.0614; Gallaugher, J., Ransbotham, S., Social media and customer dialog management at starbucks (2010) MIS Quarterly Executive, 9 (4), pp. 197-212; Garcia, R., Calantone, R., Levine, R., The Role of Knowledge in Resource Allocation to Exploration versus Exploitation in Technologically Oriented Organizations (2003) Decision Sciences, 34 (2), pp. 323-349. , DOI 10.1111/1540-5915.02407; Glebbeek, A.C., Bax, E.H., Is high employee turnover really harmful?

An understanding of the factors that affect this performance could help determine where to concentrate management efforts (and related financial resources) from a practical standpoint, and where to focus research efforts from an academic perspective. To gain further insight into these factors, this study extends prior research by integrating elements from expectancy theory, goal-setting theory, and organizational behavior specific to the software development process. The research results provide new insights regarding the relative importance of how expectancy theory, goal-setting theory, and individual characteristics affect the perceived performance of software development professionals. These preliminary findings indicate that goal-setting theory may have complex implications for software development performance. Goal difficulty has a negative relationship to performance but a positive relationship to effort. Because of this off-setting effect, the degree of goal difficulty has a relatively small overall effect on performance. Goal clarity also has a relatively small effect on performance. Individual ability has the strongest direct effect on perceived performance, more than twice as strong as the effects of work effort, personality dimensions, and perceived characteristics of the task. High achievement needs were directly related to both effort and perceived performance, whereas self-esteem and locus of control have a direct relationship to perceived performance.",Expectancy theory; Goal-setting theory; Management; Productivity; Software development performance,,,,,,,,,,"Rasch, R.H.; University of Florida, 208 Business, Gainesville, FL 32611, United States",,,,,,,,2767783,,MISQD,,English,MIS Quart Manage Inf Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000527317,

From a human resources perspective, one debate centers on how to attract and retain information technology (IT) professionals. Somewhat paradoxically, it is suggested that to retain IT professionals, organizations must provide both technical and business oriented career opportunities. This paper presents a case study of one organization, The Mutual Group, in which more than 70 IT professionals permanently moved into non-IT, business unit jobs during the 1980s and early 1990s. Using interviews and surveys of 51 former IT professionals, this research investigated the characteristics of the individual, the organization, the first non-IT job, and the transition period. The conclusion from the findings is that IT professionals who moved to non-IT jobs in the line made the transition without the benefit of deliberate preparation, formal transition programs, or safety nets to reduce the risk. Some conditions existed at The Mutual Group that may have assisted them, including good relations between IT and the line, friends and mentors in line units, and a willingness to take risks in pursuit of new challenges. One contribution of this paper is that it begins to fill a gap in the career mobility literature, based on individuals and their stories of change. It also attempts to understand the role of context in one organization that is a recognized leader in the use of IT for competitive advantage.",Career mobility; IT careers; Job transfers,Investments; Job analysis; Personnel; Professional aspects; Research and development management; Societies and institutions; Career mobility; IT careers; Job transfers; The Matual Group (TMG); Information technology,,,,,,,,"Applegate, L.M., Elam, J.J., New information systems leaders: A changing role in a changing world (1992) MIS Quarterly, pp. 469-491. , December; Bernard, H.R., (1988) Cultural Anthropology, , Sage, Newbury Park, CA; Bird, A., Careers as repositories of knowledge: A new perspective on boundaryless careers (1994) Journal of Organizational Behaviour, 15 (4), pp. 325-344. , July; Brown, M.L., (1995) A Theory of Information Technology Cultures: Magic Dragons, Wizards and Archetypal Patterns, , Ph.D. dissertation, York University, Toronto, Canada, 1995; Burke, R., McKeen, C.A., Facilitating the new manager transition: Part II (1994) Executive Development, 7 (4), pp. 10-12; Cash, J.I., McFarlan, F., McKenney, J.L., (1988) Corporate Information Systems Management, , Richard D.

In such an environment, IT human capital has assumed considerable significance. Insightful IT leaders recognize that the greatest impediments to success are often related to people rather than to information, technology, and systems. What is not quite clear to IT leaders, however, is exactly how to develop and leverage this human capital in support of business needs. The transformation of IT from a back-office support role to a strategic business partner requires new roles and competencies for IT leaders and professionals. Key challenges for IT leaders are to envision these roles and competencies and to develop and implement programs to translate this vision to reality. This paper describes the IT human resource vision that is guiding such a transformation at 3M - a large multi-product, diversified manufacturing firm (1998 sales: $15 billion) - and focuses on the implementation of its leadership initiative. This initiative was instrumental in not only allowing 3M to develop needed skills and behaviors among its IT professionals, it also helped 3M evade an industry-wide recruitment and retention trend. The major conceptual models guiding the leadership initiative as well as implementation details are presented. Challenges encountered on the way and the lessons learned from the journey are discussed. 3M's experiences provide opportunities for managers in other organizations to develop valuable insights regarding the management of human capital in IT.",Human resource strategy; Information systems professionals; Leadership development; Managing IT professionals; Recruiting and retaining IT professionals,Competition; Curricula; Personnel; Professional aspects; Societies and institutions; Strategic planning; Human resource strategy; Information systems professionals; Leadership development; Managing IT professionals; Recruiting and retaining IT professionals; Information technology,,,,,,,,"Ashkenas, R., Ulrich, D.O., Jick, T., Kerr, S., (1998) The Boundaryless Organization: Breaking the Chains of Organizational Structure, , Jossey-Bass, San Francisco; Bowen, D.E., Lawler, E.E., The empowerment of service workers: What, why, how, and when (1992) Sloan Management Review, 33 (3), pp. 31-39. , Spring; Brown, C., Examining the emergence of hybrid IS governance solutions: Evidence from a single case site (1997) Information Systems Research, 8 (1), pp. 69-94; Brown, C.V., Magill, S.L., Alignment of the IS function with the enterprise: Toward a model of antecedents (1994) M/S Quarterly, 18 (4), pp. 371-403; Byron, W.J., Coming to terms with the new corporate contract (1995) Business Horizons, 38 (1), pp. 8-15; Clark, C.E., Cavanaugh, N.C., Brown, C.V., Sambamurthy, V., Building a change ready IS organization at Bell Atlantic (1997) M/S Quarterly, 21 (4); De Pree, M., (1987) Leadership Is An Art, , Michigan State University Press, East Lansing, Ml; Greenleaf, R.K., (1991) Servant Leadership: A Journey into the Nature of Legitimate Power and Greatness, , Paulist Press, New York","Roepke, R.; 3M Company, St. Paul, MN 55133-3224, United States; email: rproepke@mmm.com",,,,,,,,2767783,,MISQD,,English,MIS Quart Manage Inf Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001338577,

During these interactions, the IT employee is expected to conform to occupational or organizational norms regarding the display of emotion. How do these display norms affect the IT professional? This study examines an IT professional's emotional dissonance, the conflict between norms of emotional display and an employee's felt emotion. Emotional dissonance is studied as a factor of IT professionals' work exhaustion, job satisfaction, and turnover intention, modeled as an extension to the work of Moore (2000a). The results indicate emotional dissonance predicts work exhaustion better than do perceived workload, role conflict, or role ambiguity, constructs which have long been associated with work exhaustion. Job satisfaction is influenced directly by role ambiguity and work exhaustion. In turn, job satisfaction influences employee turnover intention.

Such a perspective attends mainly to the use of information. Increasingly, however, organizations are concerned about the production of information. This paper focuses on the work of producing informational objects, an activity central to knowledge work. Based on data collected during an eight-month ethnographic study of three groups of knowledge workers - computer system administrators, competitive intelligence analysts, and librarians - I explore the informing practices they relied upon. These are identified as ex-pressing, monitoring, and translating. Common to these informing practices is the knowledge workers' endeavor to balance subjectivity and objectivity, where subjectivity is a necessary part of doing value adding work and objectivity promises workers authority and a sense of security. Recognizing that researchers are knowledge workers too, I draw on my own experiences as an ethnographic researcher to identify parallels between my informing practices and those of the knowledge workers I studied. These parallels are intended to challenge the taken-for-granted assumptions underlying scientific practice. I adopt a confessional genre of representation for this purpose.",Confessional genre of representation; Ethnography; Evaluation criteria; Information; Knowledge creation; Objectivity; Practice; Reflexivity; Social science; Subjectivity,Computer systems; Data acquisition; Decision making; Knowledge engineering; Research; Security of data; Social sciences; Confessional genre of representation; Ethnography; Evaluation criteria; Knowledge creation; Objectivity; Practice; Reflexivity; Subjectivity; Information science,,,,,,,,"Adler, P., Adler, P., Observational techniques (1994) Handbook of Qualitative Research, pp. 377-392. , N.

Is this just a new name for the MIS manager, or is there truly a new and significantly different function? How has the role of the information systems manager evolved with the changing needs of business? How does the CIO bridge the gap between the organization's strategy and its use of information technology? According to much of the prescriptive literature, bridging this gap is the CIO's definitive function. This article addresses these questions by studying five successful CIOs in five divergent industries. The CIOs were studied using the structured observation methodology employed by Mintzberg in his study of CEOs and by Ives and Olson in their study of MIS managers. The findings suggest that the CIO operates as an executive rather than a functional manager. He or she is an active participant in strategy planning and acts as a bridge between the information technology group, the functional areas, and external entities. This study provides a view of how these difficult tasks are accomplished on a day-to-day basis: through scheduled meetings, interaction outside the information technology unit, a skilled reading of situations, and a strategic focus. Factors affecting the CIO's participation in strategy planning meetings include whether he or she has formal resource allocation authority and their level of peer acceptance. Lessons learned from this research pertain to the delegation of day-to-day tasks, expenditure authority, avoiding adversarial relationships, liaison activities, careful use of language, being perceived as a user of information technology, and the need for quiet time.",Chief information officers; Corporate roles and relationships; IS management; Structured observation,,,,,,,,,,"Stephens, C.S.; Abbott Turner School of Business, Columbus College, Columbus, GA 31993-2399, United States",,,,,,,,2767783,,MISQD,,English,MIS Quart Manage Inf Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000699692,

Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, United States","The emerging work on understanding open source software has questioned what leads to effectiveness in OSS development teams in the absence of formal controls, and it has pointed to the importance of ideology. This paper develops a framework of the OSS community ideology (including specific norms, beliefs, and values) and a theoretical model to show how adherence to components of the ideology impacts effectiveness in OSS teams. The model is based on the idea that the tenets of the OSS ideology motivate behaviors that enhance cognitive trust and communication quality and encourage identification with the project team, which enhances affective trust. Trust and communication in turn impact OSS team effectiveness. The research considers two kinds of effectiveness in OSS teams: the attraction and retention of developer input and the generation of project outputs. Hypotheses regarding antecedents to each are developed. Hypotheses are tested using survey and objective data on OSS projects. Results support the main thesis that OSS team members' adherence to the tenets of the OSS community ideology impacts OSS team effectiveness and reveal that different components impact effectiveness in different ways. Of particular interest is the finding that adherence to some ideological components was beneficial to the effectiveness of the team in terms of attracting and retaining input, but detrimental to the output of the team.

The environment is built on top of a commercial CASE tool and does not rely on exotic technology. The delivered systems are COBOL transaction processing systems using relational database technology and are predominantly online. Two applications of approximately 200,000 lines of code have each been developed by teams at two different sites. A third application of over 2 million lines of code is nearing completion.

Taggart et al,,A Balanced Orientation for the Information Systems Manager,1979,,3,2,,21,33,,,,,,,"The orientation of an information systems department is influenced by the emphasis shown in the manager’s activities. Each incident in the manager’s daily work is another bead strung on a necklace. The choice of what type of bead it should be is up to the manager. Every incident permits a choice of emphasis: either a systems professional or a user community orientation.

Recent analyses suggest that a new breed of information systems manager must emerge for advanced systems in organizations. Some of these analyses emphasize the user view without pointing to the continuing need for systems competence.

Lest the pendulum swing too far in the opposite direction by ignoring technical aspects, this analysis suggests that the emerging information systems manager must bring a “balanced” systems and user orientation to the position. In so doing, the manager establishes the organizational climate in which the information systems activity proceeds.","information systems department, user orientation, systems professional orientation, stage of systems evolution, systems manager activity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three types of jobs were examined: programmers, systems analysts, and IS managers. The analysis of the frequency of phrases in these advertisements suggests that job ads for programmers have changed very little - technical requirements remain high, and business and systems knowledge requirements remain relatively low (although the frequency of mention of business requirements has increased somewhat). IS management positions are also relatively stable (as reflected in the makeup of job ads) from the standpoint that business knowledge requirements have remained high, with technical and systems requirements specified less frequently. The greatest transition in specified job requirements over this 20-year period has occurred for systems analysts. Although this is perhaps not surprising, the nature of this transition is. Contrary to expectations, the relative frequency and proportion of stated technical knowledge requirements in ads have increased dramatically, while the relative frequency of business and systems knowledge requirements has actually decreased slightly. These results raise questions concerning the implicit understanding by academics and practitioners alike of the need for business knowledge on the part of systems analysts and other IS professionals. Various interpretations of these findings are provided, and the implications for both education and recruitment are discussed.",Content analysis; Information systems jobs; Job advertisements; Job skills,,,,,,,,,,"Todd, P.A.; School of Business, Queen's University, Kingston, Ont.

Gender is proposed as a moderator of the relationships between valuations of different work outcomes and fit perceptions. We found support for our model in three separate studies. In each of the studies, we gathered data about the work outcomes and fit perceptions of IT workers. The studies were designed to complement each other in terms of cross-temporal validity (studies were conducted at difference points in time over 10 years, in periods of differing economic stability), and in terms of prior work experience (entry-level workers in studies 1 and 2, and those with prior work experience starting new jobs in study 3). All three studies also included data both pre-and post-organizational entry in order to further validate the robustness of the model. The studies largely supported our hypotheses that (1) the effect of extrinsic outcomes on PO fit was moderated by gender, such that it was more important to men in determining their PO fit perceptions; (2) the effects of social outcomes on both PO fit and PJ fit was moderated by gender, such that it was more important to women in determining their fit perceptions; and (3) intrinsic outcomes influenced perceptions of PJ fit for both men and women.

Nonetheless, little is known yet about the socio-cognitive acts and communication processes involved with synchronizing and cocreating understandings in such settings. Building on a case study of a geographically distributed information systems development project at one of India 's largest offshore vendors, we postulate that knowledge and experience asymmetries, and requirements and task characteristics (such as complexity, instability, ambiguity, and novelty) prompt onsite and offshore team members to engage in acts of sensegiving, sensedemanding, and sensebreaking. This allows them to make sense of their tasks and their environment, and it increases the likelihood that congruent and actionable understandings emerge. Furthermore, it assists them in cocreating novel understandings, especially when acts of sensegiving and sensedemanding are complemented with instances of sensebreaking. Our results contribute to the literature by explaining how distributed team members mitigate problems of understanding, transfer preexisting understandings, and cocreate novel understandings. Acts of sensegiving, sensedemanding, and sensebreaking allow distributed team members to jointly explore and generate value, thereby amplifying the performance of distributed workers.",Information systems development; ISD; Offshore; Sensebreaking; Sensedemanding; Sensegiving; Sensemaking; Social cognition; Understanding; Value creation,Communication systems; Distributed computer systems; Project management; Social aspects; Sense demanding; Social cognition; Value creation; Information systems,,,,,,,,"Ahuja, M.K., Carley, K.M., Network Structure in Virtual Organizations (1999) Organization Science, 10 (6), pp. 741-757; Ahuja, M.K., Galvin, J.E., Socialization in Virtual Groups (2003) Journal of Management, 29 (2), pp. 161-185; Armstrong, D.J., Cole, P., Managing Distances and Differences in Geographically Distributed Work Groups (2002) Distributed Work: New Ways of Working across Distance Using Technology, , P.

Some developers are unpaid volunteers who seek to solve their own technical problems, while others create OSS as part of their employment contract. For the past 10 years, a substantial amount of academic work has theorized about and empirically examined developer motivations. We review this work and suggest considering motivation in terms of the values of the social practice in which developers participate. Based on the social philosophy of Alasdair MacIntyre, we construct a theoretical framework that expands our assumptions about individual motivation to include the idea of a long-term, value-informed quest beyond short-term rewards. This motivation-practice framework depicts how the social practice and its supporting institutions mediate between individual motivation and outcome. The framework contains three theoretical conjectures that seek to explain how collectively elaborated standards of excellence prompt developers to produce high-quality software, change institutions, and sustain OSS development. From the framework, we derive six concrete propositions and suggest a new research agenda on motivation in OSS.",Free software; Incentives; Innovation; MacIntyre; Motivation; Open source software; Social practice,Free software; Incentives; MacIntyre; Open Source Software; Social practices; Computer software; Innovation; Motivation,,,,,,,,"Aberdour, M., Achieving quality in open-source software (2007) IEEE Software, 24 (1), pp. 58-64. , DOI 10.1109/MS.2007.2; Adams, R.M., Motive utilitarianism (1976) The Journal of Philosophy, 73 (14), pp. 467-481; Alexy, O., Leitner, M., A fistful of dollars: Are financial rewards a suitable management practice for dis-tributed models of innovation?

The study, based on data collected from 43 Australian IS managers, describes the information scanning behavior of IS executives. The investigation reports two findings: (1) IS managers who ha ve two-way communication with the CEO rate IS strategic planning as less critical; and (2) IS managers tend to scan sources that are close to the industry, and they are most influenced by their peers. The findings suggest that IS managers need to be more aware of the necessity to match the ambiguity of a message with its method of transmission, and they should consider broadening their scanning if they wish to find new opportunities for exploiting information systems technology.",IS management; Key issues; Organizational communication; Scanning,,,,,,,,,,"Watson, R.T.; Department of Management, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602, United States",,,,,,,,2767783,,MISQD,,English,MIS Quart Manage Inf Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-2942683862,

The Issue of fully developing and utilizing available human resources is currently receiving careful scrutiny in the MIS literature. One methodology for fully utilizing human resources has been maximizing productivity by stressing team effort. This research focuses on evaluating the systems development activities of two MIS project teams. Empirical evidence was gathered from interviews with MIS personnel and key users concerning strengths/ weaknesses of the two project teams. Analysis was performed to determine the personality characteristics (as measured by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) of the MIS staff. The results of this analysis indicated a void of certain personality styles in project team one. This void correlated with weaknesses ascertained from the interview data for project team one. Project team two, with all four personality styles represented, was evaluated as very successful. Recommendations are made for assembling project teams based on these findings.",Human resource management; MIS systems design; MIS systems development; Project teams,,,,,,,,,,"White, K.B.; University of North Carolina, School of Business and Economics, Greensboro, NC 27514, United States",,,,,,,,2767783,,MISQD,,English,MIS Quart Manage Inf Syst,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002594398,

A field study comprised of a survey questionnaire was chosen as the most appropriate design for this investigation. The respondents were IS managers, ranging in the organizational hierarchy from vice president or director to project manager, in both governmental and private sector organizations of varying sizes. The study reveals that job stresses among IS managers are positively related to psychological and physiological strains. While all of the stressors included in this investigation are significantly related to strain symptoms, certain stressors emerge as having the greatest Impact. Likewise, certain strains that result from these stressors are more prevalent than others. Concerning social support, the study reveals that the level of social support among IS managers is lower than among other managers. When social support exists, strain among these managers is significantly lower.
